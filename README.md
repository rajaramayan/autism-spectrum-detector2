# 🧠 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening Prediction System

A Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder in children, built as part of a thesis entitled "PREDICTION OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER IN CHILDREN USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES" in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information System Engineering at Purbanchal University School of Engineering, Nepal. The thesis is currently in progress and will be defended soon.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train Models Locally
```bash
python "ASD in Children using Machine Learning and ANN (1).py"
```
This trains all 9 models, prints evaluation metrics, shows plots, and saves all model artifacts to the `models/` folder.

### 3. Launch the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Go to **🤖 Model Training** → click **📂 Load Pre-trained Models**.
