## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train Models Locally
```bash
python "ASD in Children using Machine Learning and ANN (1).py"
```
This trains all 9 models, prints evaluation metrics, shows plots, and saves all model artifacts to the `models/` folder.

### 3. Launch the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Go to **🤖 Model Training** → click **📂 Load Pre-trained Models**.
